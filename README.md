> This repository contains the specs for InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD).

## Work In Progress

**Warning**: this is a work in progress. IPLD is a young body of work and we want to get it right. We will continue to evaluate and re-think pieces.

**Specs are not finished yet. We use the following tag system to identify their state:**

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is a work-in-progress, it is likely not even complete.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is a rough draft and will likely change substantially.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-reliable-green.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is believed to be close to final. Minor changes only.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec is likely to improve, but not change fundamentally.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-permanent-blue.svg?style=flat-square) - this spec will not change.

Nothing in this spec repository is `permanent` yet. The most important pieces of IPLD are now `reliable` or `stable`. Many subsystems remain as `draft`.

Note that, as in many IPFS repositories, most of the work is happening in [the issues](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/) or in [active pull requests](https://github.com/ipld/specs/pulls/). Go take a look!

## Contribute

Suggestions, contributions, criticisms are welcome. Though please make sure to familiarize yourself deeply with IPLD and IPFS, the models it adopts, and the principles it follows. [Join in in the issues](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues).

Please be aware that specs are really hard to design by committee. Treat this space like you would the workshop of an artist. Please suggest improvements, but please don't be disappointed if we say no to something. What we leave out is often more important than what we add in.

Check out our [contributing document](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/contributing.md) for more information on how we work, and about contributing in general. Please be aware that all interactions related to IPLD are subject to the IPFS [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
